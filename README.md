# Module 5-Pymaceuticals



## Description
 Will scan through a drug tretment study to find relations between drug effectiveness and tumors volume. There are 6 parts to this code.

### Cleaning Data - starts (cell 3)
This is where we will find any discrepancies within the data and either fix it our purge it. we will then make this into a new Data Frame
### Summary Statistics - starts (cell 8)
In this section we will calculate the Mean, Median, Variance, Standard Deviation and SEM for the Tumor Volume for each drug regimen.
### Bar and Pie Charts - starts (cell 10)
In this section we will demonstate the diffrence between the drug regimen and the number of observed mouse timepoints. We will display this in a bar chart to better communicate the differences. We will also create and display a pie chart breaking down the percentile diffrences between the sexs.
### Quartiles, Outliers and Boxplots - starts (cell 14)
Here we will break down the information even further to only display the treatments regimens of (Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin). We will find the potential outliers with in these treatment plans and then display this into a box plot which will visualy show the largest outlier.
### Line and Scatter ploting - starts (cell 17)
Here we will diplay infoirmation for a very specific drug (in this case: Capomulin) and a specific mouse (in this case: l509). These variables can be changed depnding ion the the drug of choidce and if the mouse chosen is being treated with it.
In this case Capomulin shows that the longer the mouse l509 is treated with it the smaller the tumor volume gets.

This section will also scatter plot mouse weight and average tumor volume for all mice in the Capomulin treatment regimen.
## Correlation and Regression - starts (cell 21)
This final section will creat a Linear Regreassion model that will display the correlation between Weight  and Tumor Volume.
